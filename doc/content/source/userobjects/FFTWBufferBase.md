# FFTWBufferBase

## Buffer for FFTW spectral executioners

`FFTWBufferBase` is a templated buffer that contains specific interleaved 
data buffer. Its implementation is linked to the external library FFTW. 
On construction, `FFTWBufferBase` creates `fftw_plan`s for forward and inverse 
discrete Fourier transform (DFTs). The methods `forward` and `backward` are 
equipped with profiling information and call FFTW to perform DFT. 
`FFTWBufferBase` takes care of deleting FFTW pointers by calling 
`fftw_destroy_plan` upon destruction. 

Use of `FFTWBufferBase`s can be observed in `SpectralExecutioners`.
